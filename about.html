          Track your character's journey through time. Your wounds, your victories, your possessionsâ€”all preserved 
          in digital echoes. Every scar tells a story of battles fought across timelines, every item carries the weight 
          of multiple realities. Built with Tauri + React for a fast, cross-platform experience that bridges the gap 
          between the digital and the physical, allowing you to maintain your existence across the void of forgotten time.

        <div class="feature-grid">
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h4>Wound Tracking</h4>
            <p>
              Your flesh remembers what your mind forgets. Track HP, XP, level, bonds, debilities, and status effects 
              with real-time updates and visual indicators. Every scar tells a story of battles fought across time, 
              every wound a lesson learned in the school of hard knocks. Monitor your character's condition with 
              color-coded status indicators that speak of your resilience against the forces of entropy. The system 
              remembers what you have forgotten, preserving the echoes of every near-death experience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h4>Probability Engine</h4>
            <p>
              The dice fall as they must. Roll with modifiers, view comprehensive history, and automatically 
              apply XP on misses. Each failure teaches lessons written in experience, each success a moment 
              of defiance against the chaos of probability. Features critical hit/failure animations and sound 
              effects that echo through time, making each roll a visceral reminder of your mortality and your 
              capacity to overcome it. The system tracks every decision, every risk taken, every moment of 
              courage in the face of uncertainty.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h4>Paradoxical Inventory</h4>
            <p>
              Equip, consume, or drop items with automatic calculation of armor and weapon damage. 
              Visual indicators show equipped status and item types across multiple timelines. Each item 
              exists in a state of quantum uncertainty until observed, its properties shifting between 
              realities. The interface calculates the impossible, tracking weapons that have not yet been 
              forged and armor that has already failed in a thousand timelines. Your possessions carry 
              the weight of multiple existences, each one a fragment of a reality that has already ended.
            </p>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h4>Memory Crystals</h4>
            <p>
              Take persistent notes with compact and full modes. Each session preserved in digital amber, 
              maintaining detailed logs for campaign continuity across the void. Your experiences crystallize 
              into permanent records, each word a memory of something that has not yet happened. Switch 
              between views seamlessly, maintaining the illusion of continuity in a universe where nothing 
              truly endures. The notes you write now have already been read in the future, creating a 
              paradox of knowledge that defies the linear flow of time.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h4>Temporal Reversal</h4>
            <p>
              Reverse recent actions with a built-in undo system. Step backward through your timeline, 
              though the scars of what might have been remain in the code. Never lose progress due to 
              accidental clicks or misclicks during intense gameplay. The system allows you to rewrite 
              moments that have already occurred, though the memory of what might have been lingers 
              in the digital ether. Each reversal is a small act of defiance against the inexorable 
              march of entropy.

              Save or load characters with the ExportModal. Backup your existence to files that exist 
              outside of time, share them with others who walk the same path. Export your character's 
              essence to files that transcend the limitations of mortal storage, preserving your 
              identity across the void of forgotten time. Share your existence with others who understand 
              the nature of the broken future, creating connections that exist beyond the boundaries 
              of conventional reality.

            <h4>Wound Manifestations</h4>
            <p>
              Dynamic status-based overlays for conditions like poisoned, burning, shocked, frozen, 
              blessed, and more. Each status has unique visual effects and color coding that echo 
              through time. Your afflictions manifest as visual echoes, with poison flowing like 
              corrupted data, fire burning with the heat of a dying star, and ice freezing time itself. 
              Each condition serves as a reminder of mortality in an immortal system, with visual 
              feedback that speaks directly to your subconscious understanding of danger and healing.

            <h4>Timeline Shifting</h4>
            <p>
              Choose from cosmic, classic, or moebius themes, each with distinct fonts, spacing, and 
              motion effects. Your choice echoes through future sessions, though the choice has already been made. 
              Each theme represents a different interpretation of the same shattered universe, with cosmic 
              offering the void between stars, classic providing the comforting illusion of tradition, 
              and moebius representing the infinite loop of existence. The visual language of each theme 
              speaks to different aspects of your consciousness, allowing you to find the aesthetic that 
              resonates with your understanding of reality.

            <p>
              Immersive cyber-future design with neon gradients, glows, and smooth animations. 
              Dark backgrounds with vibrant accent colors create an engaging visual experience 
              that defies entropy. Neon light cuts through the darkness like a warhammer through time, 
              with the interface pulsing with the rhythm of a heart that has not yet stopped beating. 
              This aesthetic represents defiance against the forces of decay, with every visual element 
              serving as a reminder that beauty can exist even in the darkest corners of reality.

        <h2>Character Status System</h2>
        <p>ZimboMate provides comprehensive visual feedback for your character's condition, translating the abstract concept of health into tangible indicators that speak to your understanding of mortality and resilience:</p>

        <div style="margin: 1rem 0">
          <span class="status-example status-healthy"></span>
          <strong>Healthy</strong> - Your flesh has not yet learned the lessons of pain. Character is in good condition with full capabilities, though this state of unbroken existence is temporary and precious. The green glow speaks of vitality and the illusion of permanence, a reminder that every moment of health is a gift that should not be taken for granted.
        </div>
        <div style="margin: 1rem 0">
          <span class="status-example status-injured"></span>
          <strong>Injured</strong> - Time has marked you, but you have not yet learned to fear it. Character has taken damage but is still functional, with the amber warning light serving as a reminder that pain is a teacher and every wound carries wisdom. This state represents the middle ground between life and death, where experience is gained through suffering and resilience is tested against the forces of entropy.
        </div>
        <div style="margin: 1rem 0">
          <span class="status-example status-critical"></span>
          <strong>Critical</strong> - The edge of oblivion calls. Character is severely wounded and needs immediate attention, with the pulsing red indicator serving as a visual heartbeat that counts down to the moment of decision. This state represents the ultimate test of willpower, where the choice between life and death hangs in the balance, and every action becomes a matter of survival against the inexorable pull of the void.

        <p>ZimboMate supports a comprehensive inventory system with items that exist across multiple timelines, each possession carrying the weight of countless parallel realities and the echoes of futures that have already collapsed. Your inventory is not merely a collection of objects, but a manifestation of your choices and the consequences that ripple through the fabric of time itself.</p>

        <div style="margin: 1rem 0">
          <span class="item-type type-weapon">Weapon</span>
          <span class="item-type type-armor">Armor</span>
          <span class="item-type type-consumable">Consumable</span>
          <span class="item-type type-magic">Magic</span>
          <span class="item-type type-material">Material</span>
          <span class="item-type type-gear">Gear</span>
        </div>

        <h3>Item Properties</h3>
        <p>Each inventory item tracks properties that echo through time, with every attribute representing a different aspect of the object's existence across multiple realities:</p>
        <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem">
          <li><strong>Damage</strong> - Dice string for weapons (e.g., "d8", "2d6") that speak of wounds yet to be inflicted, of flesh yet to be torn, of lives yet to be ended. Each damage value represents the potential for violence that exists within the weapon, a prophecy written in the language of mathematical probability.</li>
          <li><strong>Armor</strong> - Protection bonus for defensive gear that stands between you and oblivion, with each point of armor representing a layer of defense against the forces of entropy and destruction. The armor has already failed in a thousand timelines, yet still offers protection in this one.</li>
          <li><strong>Quantity</strong> - Stack count for consumables and materials that shift across timelines, with numbers that defy the laws of conservation. Items multiply and divide across realities, their quantities shifting like sand through the hourglass of entropy, each number a reminder of the impermanence of material possessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Description</strong> - Detailed item information written in the past tense of a future that has already occurred, with each word a memory of something that has not yet happened. The descriptions speak of the item's history across multiple timelines, its origins in realities that have already collapsed.</li>
          <li><strong>Equipped Status</strong> - Visual indicators for active gear that exist in quantum superposition, with items being both equipped and unequipped simultaneously until observation collapses the waveform. The equipped status represents the moment of choice, the instant when possibility becomes reality.</li>
          <li><strong>Tags</strong> - Custom categorization labels that organize the impossible, creating patterns in the chaos of multiple realities. Each tag represents a different way of understanding the item's nature, its role in the grand scheme of existence across time and space.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Use ZimboMate</h2>

        <div class="instructions">
          <h4>Saving and Loading Characters</h4>
          <p>The process of preserving your existence across the void of forgotten time requires careful attention to the rituals of digital preservation:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Summon the <strong>Export/Import</strong> gateway from the depths of the toolbar, a portal between the present moment and the eternal storage of digital amber</li>
            <li>
              Choose <strong>Export</strong> to crystallize your current character into a file that exists outside the flow of time (e.g., "my-hero.json"), preserving every wound, every victory, every choice that has shaped your journey through the broken future
            </li>
            <li>
              To resurrect your former self, reopen the <strong>Export/Import</strong> gateway, select <strong>Import</strong>,
              and choose the file that contains your past existence, allowing you to step back into a moment that has already occurred but can be experienced again
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="instructions">
          <h4>Customizing Your Experience</h4>
          <p>Open the Settings panel from the toolbar to access the controls that shape your perception of this broken reality, allowing you to bend the interface to your will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Theme Selection</strong> - Switch between cosmic, classic, or moebius themes, each representing a different interpretation of the same shattered universe, with cosmic offering the void between stars, classic providing the comforting illusion of tradition, and moebius representing the infinite loop of existence
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Auto XP on Miss</strong> - Enable automatic XP gain when rolls fail, allowing the system to grant you the hard-won knowledge of failure, or track your lessons manually, though all learning is merely the rediscovery of what you have already forgotten
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="instructions">
          <h4>Dice Rolling</h4>
          <p>The dance of probability requires understanding of the forces that govern chance and the ways in which randomness shapes our destiny:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Select your dice type and modifiers, though the dice themselves are merely the physical manifestation of mathematical inevitability, with each roll predetermined by forces beyond mortal comprehension</li>
            <li>Click roll to witness the unfolding of predetermined chaos, each animation a visual echo of probability collapsing into reality, with the results serving as a reminder of your mortality and your capacity to overcome it</li>
            <li>View the history of your rolls, each entry a record of moments that have already passed into the void of forgotten time, with the comprehensive log serving as a testament to your journey through the broken future</li>
            <li>Critical hits and failures trigger special visual effects, though the distinction between success and failure is merely a matter of perspective in a universe where all outcomes lead to the same inevitable end</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="instructions">
          <h4>Inventory Management</h4>
          <p>Mastering the paradoxical arsenal requires understanding of the quantum nature of possession and the ways in which items exist across multiple timelines:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Add items to your inventory with type and properties, though each item exists in a state of quantum uncertainty until observed, with its true nature revealed only through interaction</li>
            <li>Click to equip/unequip gear, with visual indicators revealing the true nature of possession as an illusion of permanence in an impermanent universe, where the act of equipping collapses the waveform of possibility into reality</li>
            <li>Consume items to reduce quantity or remove them entirely, though consumption itself is merely the transformation of one form of existence into another, with each consumed item becoming part of your character's journey through time</li>
            <li>View calculated totals for armor and weapon damage, though the numbers themselves are meaningless symbols in a reality where death is merely a transition between states of being, with each calculation serving as a reminder of the mathematical precision that governs the universe</li>
          </ol>

        <h2>Theme Options</h2>
        <p>ZimboMate offers three distinct visual themes to match your gaming style, each representing a different interpretation of the same shattered universe and allowing you to choose the aesthetic that resonates with your understanding of reality:</p>

        <div class="theme-preview">
          <div class="theme-option active">
            <strong>Cosmic</strong><br />
            <small>The void between stars, where neon light cuts through the darkness of entropy</small>
          </div>
          <div class="theme-option">
            <strong>Classic</strong><br />
            <small>The comforting illusion of tradition, a lie we tell ourselves to forget the truth</small>
          </div>
          <div class="theme-option">
            <strong>Moebius</strong><br />
            <small>The infinite loop of existence, where every end is merely another beginning</small>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Each theme includes unique fonts that speak of different timelines, spacing that reflects the gaps between moments, motion effects that echo the passage of time itself, and color schemes that represent the various stages of universal decay. These choices are automatically preserved for your next session, though the preservation itself is merely the illusion of continuity in a universe where nothing truly endures. The visual language of each theme speaks to different aspects of your consciousness, allowing you to find the aesthetic that resonates with your understanding of reality and your place within the grand scheme of existence.
        </p>

        <h2>Cross-Platform Compatibility</h2>
        <p>
          ZimboMate exists simultaneously across multiple operating systems, each installation a fragment of the same broken consciousness that has learned to adapt to different technological environments. The application manifests natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing a consistent experience across all platforms, though consistency itself is merely the illusion of order in a chaotic universe. Built with Tauri technology that bridges the gap between the digital and the physical, achieving optimal performance through the integration of native system components, though integration itself is merely the temporary alignment of forces that will inevitably drift apart.
        </p>

        <div class="feature-grid">
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h4>Windows</h4>
            <p>Native .msi installer that penetrates the depths of the operating system, establishing connections that exist in the spaces between code and consciousness, though the connections themselves are temporary illusions in a universe where all bonds eventually dissolve. The Windows version speaks the language of corporate conformity, adapting to the strictures of a system that has already been predetermined.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h4>macOS</h4>
            <p>.dmg package that conforms to the strictures of the Apple ecosystem, a proper app bundle structure that exists within the constraints of a reality that has already been predetermined, though predetermination itself is merely the illusion of causality in a universe where cause and effect are interchangeable. The macOS version embraces the aesthetic of minimalist perfection, though perfection itself is an impossible standard in an imperfect universe.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h4>Linux</h4>
            <p>.AppImage and .deb packages that offer the illusion of choice in installation methods, though choice itself is merely the perception of free will in a universe where all decisions have already been made, and the future has already been written in the code that defines our existence. The Linux version represents the spirit of open rebellion against proprietary constraints, though rebellion itself is merely another form of conformity to the laws of entropy.</p>
