# Character HUD and Inventory Modal

HUD widgets and the inventory dialog now compose the shared **Panel**, **Card**, and **Toolbar** primitives styled with Tailwind utilities. Legacy CSS modules have been removed.

These primitives pull from the project's design tokens (colors, radius, spacing, shadows) so new HUD elements should reuse them for visual consistency.
