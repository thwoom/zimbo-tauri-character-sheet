# Root Element Initialization

Ensures the application verifies that the `#root` element exists before mounting. This prevents runtime errors when embedding the app in hosts missing the expected container.

## Migration Notes

If customizing the mount point, update `src/main.tsx` to reference the new element id or ensure `<div id="root"></div>` exists in `index.html`.
