# Bug Report for PR: feat: add equipment and inventory panels

## Summary

I've run a comprehensive bug scan on the PR as requested. Here are the findings:

## 1. ‚úÖ Linting Status: PASSED

- No ESLint errors or warnings found
- Code style and quality checks are passing

## 2. ‚ùå Unit Tests: 5 FAILURES

### Failed Tests:

#### 1. **Command Palette Test** - `src/App.test.jsx`

- **Test**: "Command palette > opens with Ctrl+K and runs a command"
- **Error**: Found multiple elements with the role "heading" and name `/inventory/i`
- **Issue**: The test is finding both the new InventoryPanel heading and the command palette inventory option
- **Fix needed**: Update test selector to be more specific

#### 2-4. **Theme Switching Tests** - `src/App.test.jsx`

- **Tests**: Theme updates for classic, moebius, and arwes themes
- **Error**: Expected 'cosmic-v2' but received 'moebius'
- **Issue**: Theme tests are expecting the wrong default theme
- **Fix needed**: Update test expectations or fix theme initialization

#### 5. **AddItemModal Test** - `src/components/AddItemModal.test.jsx`

- **Test**: "generates options and saves selected item"
- **Error**: Expected property name mismatch: `effects` vs `effect`
- **Issue**: The test expects `effects` property but the component is using `effect`
- **Fix needed**: Align property names between test and component

### Additional Test Warnings:

- **Controlled Input Warning** in AddItemModal - changing from controlled to uncontrolled input
- **CSS Custom Properties Error** in ThemeContext tests - getComputedStyle failing in test environment

## 3. ‚ùå E2E Tests: FAILED TO RUN

### Issues:

1. **Missing Rust/Cargo**: `failed to run 'cargo metadata' command`
2. **Missing WebKitWebDriver**: Required for Tauri e2e tests
3. **Setup timeout**: Tests couldn't initialize within 120 seconds

## 4. üîß Dependency Issues Fixed

- Removed Windows-specific dependency `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc` that was preventing Linux installation
- This was blocking all test runs initially

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed:

1. **Update test selectors** in App.test.jsx to handle multiple inventory headings
2. **Fix theme test expectations** to match actual default theme
3. **Align property names** in AddItemModal (`effects` ‚Üí `effect`)
4. **Fix controlled input warning** in AddItemModal

### Test Environment Setup:

1. Install Rust and Cargo for e2e tests
2. Install WebKitWebDriver: `sudo apt install webkit2gtk-driver`
3. Consider adding these as documented prerequisites

### Code Quality:

- Despite test failures, the actual code appears to be well-structured
- No linting errors indicates good code style compliance
- The failures are primarily test-related rather than implementation bugs

## Next Steps

1. Fix the failing unit tests by updating test expectations
2. Address the controlled/uncontrolled input warning
3. Document e2e test prerequisites more clearly
4. Consider adding CI checks for these dependencies
